## Assignment 1: Getting Set-Up (10 Points)

The purpose of this assignment is to make sure you have the tools you'll need you to use
for COGS108. Notably, we'll be using Python, Jupyter notebooks, and git/GitHub. Since we're using [datahub](http://datahub.ucsd.edu) you won't *need* a local version of Jupyter or Python on your computer. So, for this assignment, we'll focus on getting you set up on GitHub.

The sections will include a git/GitHub tutorial and support for getting everything installed. 

### Tasks / Learning Goals

- Get set up with git & GitHub and get used to the assignment procedures
- Software distribution and version control with git

### Submitting Assignments

For each assignment, you will complete, validate and submit a Python 3 Jupyter notebook file (.ipynb) on [datahub](http://datahub.ucsd.edu). 


### Grading Rubric

Questions have points as specified in the detailed instructions. Make sure all the
specified repos and files that you make on GitHub are *public*, and that you type your GitHub username in properly. Automated procedures will be used to check that these repos exist, that the Pull Request was received, and that the submitted Jupyter notebook runs as expected. Note that this assignment is effectively Pass/Fail - as long as you complete all parts, you will receive full points.

### Detailed Instructions

**Part 1 (5 points)**:

1. If you do not already have one, create a GitHub account 
  - Follow instructions here: https://github.com/
2. Clone the class repositories
  - Go to the class organization: https://github.com/COGS108
  - Clone 'Lectures-Fa19', 'Section_Workbooks', and 'Projects'
3. Make a public repo on your GitHub called 'COGS108_Repo'
  - Make sure this repository is public
4. Add a README and a .gitignore to 'COGS108_Repo'
  - These can contain anything you want.
5. Make a Pull Request
  - Fork the COGS108 repo called 'MyFirstPullRequest' to your GitHub account.
    - Go to the COGS108/MyFirstPullRequest on GitHub. On the top right of the page, click on the 'Fork' button and click through to Fork the repository to your GitHub account
  - Clone that fork on your computer.
    - If you're using the SourceTree GUI, click + New Repository, Clone from URL
  - You are going to add a txt file with a unique identifier, made up of the First Letter of your last name + the last 4 digits of your Student ID. For example, John Smith - A12345678 should submit 'S5678.txt'. 
    - The contents of this file do not matter (it can be empty). 
    - Add this file to your cloned repository (the folder on your computer).
    - A 'txt' file is a plain text file. It should have the extension '.txt'. You may need to specify, in your preferred text editor, to save this filetype.
  - Push these updates to the cloned repo, on your GitHub account.
    - If using SourceTree, it should notice the updates. Commit them, then Push.
  - Go to GitHub.com, to '/YourAcct/MyFirstPullRequest' where you should now see your txt file. Create a Pull-Request.
    - Click on 'New Pull Request'
    - Click on 'Create Pull Request' (in green)
    - Replace the commit message with the same identifier (ex - 'S5678')
    - Click 'Create Pull Request. You're done!

**Part 2 (5 points)**:

Follow the instructions on the assignment on datahub for Assignment 1. Be sure to write in your Student ID and GitHub username to the Assignment 1 notebook, and follow the instructions for the python questions. Write some code to answer the python questions.
